Bu-Mot
======

This is a dutton speedwords <==> english dictionary app
based on the dictionary from:

http://www2.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~jrk/conlang.dir/Speedwords.dict

With this app you can consult the dictionary in both ways:
from speedwords to english and from english to speedwords.

Technical info
--------------

The dictionary file is parsed by a Python script to make
a SQLite database, which is consulted by a 
C++/wxWidgets/Boost app.

I think you should be able to compile this App on Windows. 
Surely it works on Linux. You will need CMake and the 
wxWidgets toolkit. I'm working with wxWidgets 2.9.3.

Microsoft Windows users: you can download your binary here:
